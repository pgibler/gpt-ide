I'm going to post each file and the errors it has. Can you help me with these errors?

chatController - Namespace '"vscode"' has no exported member 'WebviewElement'.ts(2694), Property 'find' does not exist on type 'Webview'.ts(2339) (2x)
chatPanelView - Namespace '"vscode"' has no exported member 'WebviewElement'.ts(2694), Property 'find' does not exist on type 'Webview'.ts(2339), 

If you have the solution for them, please output the files and their updated code. Include an explanation of what you changed from the last version so I can follow along better. Thank you!
